This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Baayen & Milin (2010) recommend blah blah blah.

We try the inverse-normal distribution (Baayen & Milin, 2010),

You can also embed plots, for example:

~~~~ {.r}
plot(cars)
~~~~

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2.png)
